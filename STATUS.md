# Status

Last updated: Phase 1 (real foundation) — **F1 committed, F2 complete and verified
(uncommitted at the time of writing)**.

## Phase history

| Phase | State |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — mocked demo | ✅ built, verified |
| GATE 1 — human visual approval | ✅ **approved** ("I'm happy with demo functions and look") |
| Phase 1 — real foundation | 🔄 in progress (F1 ✅, F2 ✅) |
| GATE 2 — foundation verification | ⏳ pending |

## F1 — Repo & infra ✅

| Area | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Python tooling | `pyproject.toml` — ruff (lint + format), `mypy --strict`, pytest + coverage, bandit |
| Pre-commit | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — hygiene, ruff, ruff-format, mypy, bandit, frontend typecheck, frontend eslint; gitleaks bound to `manual` (D1-03) |
| Commit gate | husky `pre-commit` + `commit-msg`, commitlint (Conventional Commits), lint-staged |
| Backend | `app/core/config.py` fail-fast settings, `app/core/logging.py` structlog + PII redaction, `app/core/middleware.py` request/trace IDs, `app/main.py` factory + error envelope, `/api/v1/health` |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4 + TanStack Query + Zustand + next-themes + next-intl (en, bn), ESLint flat config, Prettier, `[locale]` routing |
| Scripts | `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` (one-command setup), `scripts/run-frontend-check.mjs` |
| Env | `.env.example` documents every setting read by `Settings` |

## F2 — MySQL 8 + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic + outbox relay ✅

| Area | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Schema | `backend/app/db/base.py` (declarative base, deterministic constraint names, `TimestampMixin`, `TenantMixin`), `types.py` (portable `GUID` → `CHAR(36)`), `enums.py`, `session.py` (`build_engine` / `build_session_factory` / `session_scope`, pool args skipped for SQLite) |
| Migrations | `backend/alembic.ini` (no hard-coded URL), `backend/migrations/env.py` (explicit config URL → `DATABASE_URL` → `Settings`, `compare_type` on, batch mode for SQLite), `versions/0001_initial_schema.py` — baseline for all ten tables |
| Models | `tenant.py` (`Tenant`, `User`), `contract.py` (`Contract`, `ExtractedField`), `delivery.py` (`AgentDecision`, `Notification`, `CustomerResponse`), `escalation.py` (`Escalation`, `AuditLog`), `outbox.py` (`OutboxEvent`) |
| Repositories | `TenantScopedRepository` — refuses construction without a tenant; `get()` returns `None` for another tenant's id (D2-02). `OutboxRepository` — lease-fenced `claim_due` / `record_outcome`, bounded exponential backoff with ±20 % jitter, error truncation |
| Relay | `backend/app/workers/outbox_relay.py` — transport-agnostic `EventPublisher`; `UnavailablePublisher` **raises** rather than no-ops so nothing is silently log-and-dropped; outcome recorded in its own transaction (at-least-once); SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful stop |
| Compose | `docker-compose.yml` — MySQL 8.4 (loopback-bound), `api`, and a separate `relay` service on the same image so publishing survives API restarts |

## Verification actually run (F2)

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full suite, real MySQL | `pytest backend/tests` with `MYSQL_TEST_URL` set | **82 passed** |
| Full suite, no MySQL | `pytest backend/tests` with `MYSQL_TEST_URL` unset/blank | **79 passed, 3 skipped** |
| MySQL integration only | `pytest -m integration` | **pass** (3 tests) |
| Pre-commit gate | `pre-commit run --all-files` | **all 16 hooks passed** |
| Security lint (gate scope) | `bandit -c pyproject.toml -r backend/app` | 0 issues |
| Security lint (repo-wide) | `bandit -c pyproject.toml -r backend` | 0 Medium/High; 170 Low, **all in `backend/tests`** (165 × B101 `assert_used`, 5 × B106 hard-coded fixture passwords) |

The three integration tests are the only ones that need a database server beyond
SQLite. They are skipped — not failed — when MySQL is unreachable.

```powershell
docker compose up -d mysql
$env:MYSQL_TEST_URL = "mysql+pymysql://contract_agent:contract_agent@127.0.0.1:3306/contract_agent_test"
venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -m integration backend/tests
```

`MYSQL_TEST_URL` points at a **disposable** database — the tests drop and
recreate the schema. A set-but-blank value falls back to the default rather than
erroring (regression-tested).

### What the MySQL tests prove that SQLite cannot

1. **`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` works.** SQLite has no `FOR UPDATE`;
   SQLAlchemy silently omits the clause, so the SQLite suite would pass even if
   the clause were deleted. The test runs two workers on separate connections and
   asserts they claim **disjoint** rows.
2. **Enums are native MySQL `ENUM(...)`** columns with the expected values.
3. **The baseline migration applies to real MySQL** and creates every table in
   `Base.metadata` — i.e. the DDL operators will actually ship is valid.

These tests earned their keep immediately: they caught **D2-06**, where MySQL's
second-precision `DATETIME` *rounds* microseconds on insert, so an event
enqueued "now" could be stored as not-yet-due and be skipped by the relay that
just wrote it. Timestamps are now floored before writing.

## Known gaps / issues

1. **`gitleaks` needs Docker** and is manual-stage only (D1-03). Run
   `pre-commit run gitleaks --all-files` before pushing, or rely on CI.
2. **`make` is optional** — not installed on the primary Windows host; `npm`
   scripts are the contract (D1-09).
3. **Bandit's gate scope is `backend/app`.** A repo-wide `bandit -r backend`
   reports 170 Low findings, all of them in test code (`assert_used`,
   hard-coded fixture passwords). This is deliberate: `B101` in tests carries no
   signal, and narrowing the app scope to silence it would be worse than
   documenting it.
4. **`/health/ready` does not exist yet** — `/api/v1/health` is liveness only.
5. **The Kafka transport is not implemented.** The relay ships with
   `UnavailablePublisher`, which raises, so rows retry with backoff and then park
   as failed for an operator. Nothing is silently dropped, but nothing is
   delivered either — the outbox is wired end-to-end except the wire itself.
6. **No auth yet.** `TenantScopedRepository` enforces the tenant predicate, but
   nothing yet derives `tenant_id` from an authenticated principal. Until that
   lands, tenant scoping is a well-tested contract without a producer.

## Next permitted step

The outstanding foundation work (the operations described in the delivery plan as
F3 onward) is **not recorded anywhere in this repository** — `README.md`,
`DECISIONS.md`, `STATUS.md` and `DEMO.md` name F1/F2 only. The F3…F7 breakdown
lives in the task specification, so it needs to be restated before further
milestones are built, rather than guessed at.

## Non-negotiable reminders

- No low-confidence field may reach the notification pipeline.
- No cloud LLM; Ollama local only.
- Daily-scan + date compare; never a delayed 60-day message.
- Outbox + idempotency for every side effect; DLQ with replay, never log-and-drop.
- No channel switch that bypasses consent, opt-out or quiet hours.
- No raw PII in logs, traces, Ollama payloads or MLflow.
- Tenant identity comes from the authenticated principal, never from the client.
